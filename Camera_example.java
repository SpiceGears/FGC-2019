     * We need to tell Vuforia where the camera is located on the Robot Coordinate System.

     * Once Vuforia sees the target, it is this robot origin point that Vuforia will give the
     * coordinates of, relative to the target.
     *
     * For example, if you want to know the where the front center of your robot is in comparison
     * to the target, you should consider the robot's origin point to be at the center of the front
     * edge of the physical robot.
     *
     * If your camera happens to be located at the robot's origin point, than you can set these
     * values to zero. If your camera is located somewhere else, you will need to specify where,
     * by changing these values. Like all distance values for the FIRST Global Vuforia system, this
     * will be measured in millimeters.
     *
     * In the Robot Coordinate System, the X axis extends horizontally from the robot's origin point
     * to the right. So if your robot's origin point is on the center of the front edge of the robot,
     * and your camera's lens is located 50mm to the left of the robot's center, then your
     * CAMERA_LOCATION_ON_ROBOT_X_MM value should be -50.
     *
     * The Y axis of the Robot Coordinate System extends horizontally straight out in front
     * of the robot. If your camera is located 20 mm behind the origin point, then your
     * CAMERA_LOCATION_ON_ROBOT_Y_MM value should be -20.
     *
     * The Z axis of the Robot Coordinate system extends vertically from the origin point, towards
     * the ceiling. You don't need to worry about the Z axis unless your camera is able to move up
     * and down, in which case, you should define your origin point as being on the same
     * vertically-moving mechanism as the camera. If your camera and origin point cannot move up and
     * down, then the Z value reported by Vuforia will always stay the same, and thus be irrelevant.

    /**
     * Next, we need to define the values that will tell Vuforia in which direction the camera is
     * pointing. To do this, you need to understand the Camera Coordinate System. The origin of the
     * Camera Coordinate System lies in the middle of the sensor inside of the camera.
     *
     * The Z axis of the Camera Coordinate System extends from the camera's origin point straight
     * out of the lens of the camera. When looking at the face of the camera (down the positive Z
     * axis), the X axis is positive off to the right in the plane of the sensor, and the Y axis
     * is positive out the top of the lens in the plane of the sensor.
     *
     * By default, the camera is considered to have its coordinate system aligned with the Robot
     * Coordinate System. This means that by default, the camera is facing upward, with its X axis
     * pointing to the right of the robot, and its Y axis pointing at the front of the robot.
     *
     * Vuforia will rotate the camera first along the robot's X axis, then along the robot's Y axis,
     * then along the robot's Z axis. Note that the rotations are done on the ROBOT's axes, not the
     * cameras. This means that after the camera is rotated along the robot's X axis, the X, Y, and Z
     * axes that you are rotating the camera on stay in place, and do not move with the camera.
     *
     * When you are rotating the camera along an axis, positive numbers mean counter-clockwise
     * rotation. There is a trick you can use to help you with this. If you align your thumb with the
     * positive direction of an axis, rotating in a positive direction will rotate the object in the
     * same direction that your fingers are curling.
     *
     * To tie all this together, lets do an example. You probably want your camera pointed in the
     * same direction as the robot. The first thing that Vuforia will do is rotate the camera (from
     * being pointed at the ceiling) along the robot's X axis, which is pointing to the right of the
     * robot. If we stick our thumb to the robot's right, we'll see that our fingers curl towards
     * the back of the robot. Therefore, we want to turn the camera 90 degrees negatively along the
     * X axis.
     *
     * This points the camera towards the front of the robot, but it is now upside down. The Y axis
     * points at the front of the robot, so if we turn the camera 180 degrees along it, it will be
     * right side up. The camera is now pointed at the front of the robot, so for this example, we
     * do not need to rotate the camera along the Z axis.

    /**
     * The rest of the program shows how to obtain the robot's coordinates relative to the target.
     * These values are in the Target Coordinate System*. The target coordinate system is oriented
     * the same as the Robot Coordinate System, but with the center of the target as the origin
     * point, instead of the robot. This means that if the robot is 200 millimeters to the right of
     * the target, and 500 millimeters back from the target, then the robot's X position will be
     * 200, and the robot's Y position will be -500.
     *
     * To get which direction the robot is facing (heading), you want to look at the Z angle, since
     * Z is the axis which points straight up. Positive Z angle values means that the robot is
     * rotated counterclockwise from the target. The X and Y angles will give you pitch and yaw,
     * respectively.
